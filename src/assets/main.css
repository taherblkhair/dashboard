/* Removed an aggressive large-screen layout that forced the <body>
   to become flex and set #app to a two-column grid. That created
   visible gutters showing the page background (dark in dark mode)
   and made the layout non-responsive. The app uses Tailwind for
   responsive layout, so keep #app centered but don't change the
   document flow at the body level. */

/* Ensure the document background stays light so the centered #app
  doesn't reveal a dark page edge (visible on some systems when
  prefers-color-scheme: dark is active). If you prefer a dark
  theme, we can instead add a toggle; for now keep the page
  background white to match the app panels. */
